# hello-world
I'm looking to get a collaboration with anyone who's interested in learning to code with me. The long run would be to have a sustainable income to start working from home, and hopefully start running a business.

Ideally I would be looking to learn with someone at the same level or someone who has knowledge with coding who could teach me what I need to know to start off with.

Ideas for apps/games that aren't widely available at the moment. I do have Design qualifications so I'm able to work within multiple sections of developement.
